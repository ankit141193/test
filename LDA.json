The service , flight times , snacks , baggage handling was all excellent .

Ordered sandwiches that didn\\\u0027t cost a lot and got plenty of food. We\\\u0027re never fly any other airline.\"\\r\\n\"Flying first class on a 737 is very comfortable. If you fly economy on one of these sardine cans I feel sorry for you, unless you are under 5 feet tall and weigh less than 100 lbs. It\\\u0027s all about the bottom line. If you can book a flight on an Airbus you will be much more comfortable.\"\\r\\n\"I flew on Sun Country from Minneapolis to LA several times this past summer and fall. Each time the service was excellent, the fares were competitive and the ease of using Terminal 2 in MSP and Terminal 5 in LAX was great. Short lines every time we flew!

The flight itself was fine; the service was...\"\\r\\n\"The flight was awesome for getting exactly what you what you pay for. Nothing more, Crew were friendly and courteous, HOWEVER, the Airport though it may be modern and beautiful and all. However the Airport is NOT!. A.D.A. FRIENDLY.

Everything went as planned. With Delta, nothing went as planned.\"\\r\\n\"I have flown on Sun Country off and on for years since relocating to Florida from Minnesota. On a recent flight, I was very pleased to see the same great local Minnesota friendly, helpful staff. The airline also offers meal options to purchase at not too high a price, which helps a weary traveler. MOST important, unlike most other airlines...\"\\r\\n\"Wow, Sun Country. How the mighty have fallen. We used to love flying Sun Country. 1st Class was affordable and very comfortable. But no more. No pillows, no blankets, and frankly, flight attendants that aren\\\u0027t too happy about the no frills approach the airline has moved to.

It was the cheapest, and you get what you pay for. They do have a sense of Minnesota hospitality and they don\\ufffdt have as many fees hidden in fare as other budget airlines. We boarded and took off late both ways. I\\ufffdd fly again, but only if it\\ufffds the cheapest.\"\\r\\nOur seats were in First class. Our flight boarded on time and departed on time. The meal served was better than average and the service was excellent.\\r\\n\"We were able to board quickly and get off the ground. The staff were attentive to questions I had. We arrived 20 minutes early, which is always a good thing.\"\\r\\n\"It was a package deal from Green Bay. The flight and hotel were included and it was very nice. The airline was very crowded, but nice and the flight attendants were very good.\"\\r\\n\"Flew out economy MSP to Cancun, and flew back first class Cancun to MSP. Both times was excellent. On time, super friendly gate and ticket agents, and then outstanding service on the flight as well from flight attendants, and others. Airfair was cheap.

Everything was very professional and quick! Decent legroom, clean...\"\\r\\nNice clean plane and very good service. I wish they had a different way to board the plane.
